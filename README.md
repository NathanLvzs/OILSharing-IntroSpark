# OILSharing-IntroSpark

This repo is for holding relevant stuff that YAO Fangjie and I made for a sharing talk in Open Innovation Lab, CUHK.


- Introduction to Apache Spark.pdf: converted from the powerpoint file, modified a little bit after the talk

- notebook.ipynb: IPython notebook file containing the example codes

- notebook.py: the Python script converted from notebook.ipynb

- notebook.html: converted from notebook.ipynb, just for convenience. You can open and read it in a browser instead of having to use IPython notebook to load notebook.ipynb

- test.txt: input data file for wordcount example

- users.txt: input data file for simple community detection example

- dataflow.png: image used in the notebook

- graph.png: image used in the notebook
